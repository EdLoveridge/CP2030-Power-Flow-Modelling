Modelling the additional infrastructure required for CP2030

Executive Summary
This report develops a reduced model of Great Britain’s (GB) extra high voltage transmission system
to assess the impact of achieving the Clean Power 2030 (CP30) target that the UK government has
committed to. A geospatial technical analysis was conducted in four sections:

1. A simplified model of GB’s electricity transmission system was created.

2. A power flow simulation was performed for a scenario with peak demand and peak renewable generation in 2025 to evaluate system performance and losses.
   
3. The capacity of new renewable sources was calculated in order to meet CP30’s target, and a power
flow simulation was run for 2030 to assess CP30’s impact on the transmission network.

4. Two strategies to alleviate network stresses were evaluated and tested with the reduced model: i)
Increase the number of overhead lines (OHLs) throughout the network. ii) Construct two HVDC cables
from Scotland to England.

Here are some of the main results:

• In the 2025 scenario, total transmission losses reached 2.8 GW (4.46%), and over half of the
modelled transmission lines exceeded their rated capacity.

• When additional renewable capacity needed for CP30 was included, losses increased to 3.1 GW,
and loadings rose on most lines that were already constrained and overloaded.

• In2025 and2030 there was significant network stress in the North to South power transfer corridors,
resulting in transmission bottlenecks.

• Reinforcing AC OHLs significantly reduces average line loading but will be socially challenging.
HVDC links provide a smaller reduction in network stresses at a much larger cost, but are socially
more acceptable.

The report’s findings indicate that GB’s transmission infrastructure requires a substantial investment to
enable a future where CP30 becomes reality. Otherwise, CP30 will increase constraints, curtailment and
operational costs of the electricity system.
